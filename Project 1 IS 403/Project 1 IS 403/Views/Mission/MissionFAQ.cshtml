        <p class="pBuffer"><strong>What is a typical day like?</strong></p>
        <p>
            A missionary's day is filled with activities that help accomplish the missionary purpose of bringing
            souls to Christ. Read the <i>Missionary Daily Schedule</i> to see the activities in a typical day, and
            study the lessons in chapter 3 of <i>Preach My Gospel</i> to find what missionaries teach. One way to
            understand day-to-day missionary activities is to watch <i>The District</i>. These video segments show
            real missionaries, members, and investigators in non-scripted, unrehearsed, actual missionary situations.
        </p>

        <p class="pBuffer"><strong>How can I best prepare for this mission?</strong></p>
        <p>
            Work on strengthening your own understanding and testimony of the gospel by praying daily and studying the
            scriptures, especially the Book of Mormon. Attend your Church meetings. Participate in seminary or institute,
            if available. You may share the gospel with a friend, go to teaching appointments with the full-time
            missionaries, or ask recently returned missionaries about their experiences in the mission field. You may
            also become familiar with Preach My Gospel, especially chapters 1 and 3. For additional counsel on your
            preparation, see a recent interview with Brother David L. Beck, Young Men general president.
